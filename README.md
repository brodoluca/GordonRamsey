## Idea 
The idea is to treat every truck as if it was a node in a linked list. Every truck will have a server and a client part (For a lack of a better term). It wall us the client to connect to the car in front and the server to allow the truck behind to connect to itself. If we treat the platoon as a linked list, we can manage to abstract the whole thing, including operations like resizing, and to estimate the performace as well.
