Distance of the route
Max match of the route
consumption 
Body characteristcs
Sensors

function that assigns a final value based on:

value = w1 * quantity of sensors + w2* types_of_sensors + w3*distance_goal*has_goal - w4* consumption - w5*body.age + w6*body.reliability - w6*milage - w7*incidents



the more, the better,
the more variety, the better
Every truck will have a set of sensors, different from each other, with certain types  (struct with number of sensor, type of sensor (array of a specific enum type calles "Sensors type"))
Struct sensor {
    int num of sensors, 
    std::vector<sensor_type> sensor type;
}

enum sensor_type{
    lidar, 
    camera, 
    microphone, 
    infrared sensor, 
    sonar
}


the further, the better.

Every truck will have an objective a goal to reach, which is defined by:

struct goal{
float distance. 
bool hasGoal;
}


consumption. A number that defines the amount of km per liter
the less, the better

float consumption


Body characteristcs

struct body{
    age, 
    reliability, 
    milage, 
    incidents. 
}
